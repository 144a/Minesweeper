# Minesweeper

Well, I was bored on a 10 hour car ride, and the only thing I had was a crappy laptop that happened to have a processing IDE. Luckily, I had the great idea of making minesweeper and then playing that instead of sitting there and doing nothing. I got to work, and ended up falling asleep before finishing it. This is the current version, and updates will be made when I have time to make the game 100% playable. 

The most annoying thing about this project was drawing the number sprites and scaling them correctly with the scaling constant I added (why did I ever decide that was a good idea).

You can change the game setting in the sketch before running to customize the game.
